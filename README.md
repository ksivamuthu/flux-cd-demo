# What is GitOps?

GitOps is the code-based infrastructure and operational procedures that rely on Git as a source control system.

# **GitOps Principles**

There are four key principles of GitOps that drive its implementation:

1. Describe the entire system declaratively
2. Version the canonical desired system state in Git
3. Automatically apply approved changes to the desired state
4. Ensure correctness and alert on divergence with software agents
